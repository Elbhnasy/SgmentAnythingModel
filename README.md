# SgmentAnythingModel

The **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image. It has been trained on a [dataset](https://segment-anything.com/dataset/index.html) of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks.

## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```

## <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started

First download a [model checkpoint](#model-checkpoints). Then the model can be used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt:

```
from segment_anything import SamPredictor, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from segment_anything import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```

Additionally, masks can be generated for images from the command line:

```
python scripts/amg.py --checkpoint <path/to/checkpoint> --model-type <model_type> --input <image_or_folder> --output <path/to/output>
```

See the examples notebooks on [using SAM with prompts](/notebooks/predictor_example.ipynb) and [automatically generating masks](/notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb) for more details. Additionally, explore this community-created [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/D-D6ZmadzPE) and the corresponding [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-segment-anything-with-sam.ipynb).

## ONNX Export
See the [example notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/notebooks/onnx_model_example.ipynb) for details on how to combine image preprocessing via SAM's backbone with mask prediction using the ONNX model. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of PyTorch for ONNX export.



Image ids can be found in sa_images_ids.txt which can be downloaded using the above [link](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/) as well.

To decode a mask in COCO RLE format into binary:

```
from pycocotools import mask as mask_utils
mask = mask_utils.decode(annotation["segmentation"])
```

See [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/mask.py) for more instructions to manipulate masks stored in RLE format.
